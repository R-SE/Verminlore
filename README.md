Verminlore is an unofficial fansite for the "Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide" series, and has no affiliation with its developer, Fatshark, nor do I claim any ownership of image assets used. This was created as a practice project to utilize a development environment and work with HTML/CSS/ReactJS.

Verminlore is roleplayed from the perspective of a historian tracking the events of the Vermintide game.
